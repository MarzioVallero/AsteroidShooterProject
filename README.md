# Asteroid Shooter  

Asteroid Shooter is a C++ OpenGL, GLEW and GLUT based game.  
It features a basic tower defense gameplay inspired by [Visceral Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_Games)'s [Dead Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(video_game)) level in the [Chapter 4 - Obliteration Imminent](https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4:_Obliteration_Imminent), of which I report a link to [original gameplay](https://youtu.be/STHRm-_DqEA?t=113) for comparison.  
The art and sound design style has been inspired by [Creative Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Assembly)'s [Alien: Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation) and by [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars).

Here's a quick demo of Asteroid Shooter's gameplay:
